Change

revision = int(r.text.split('"client_revision":', 1)[1].split(",", 1)[0])

to

revision = 1

I don't see exact use of this revision and It works just fine for me! You can use any integer you want as the value.

Thanks @dbieber for your perfect solution! There was a problem before for using the user agent. I think You've solved two problem at once!
